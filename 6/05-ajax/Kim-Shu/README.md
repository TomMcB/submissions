##Description

The project utilizes the NY Times API to function as an "article search",
taking in search queries and displaying one article at a time to the user, on a 5 second timer.
(Takes some time to make the call)
If there's no search, it automatically displays articles about Donald Trump

The user can also use the reverse the displaying order

To run do:

```sh
python app.py
```
