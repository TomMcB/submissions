Stock Tickers Live
==================

Using the [Markit On Demand](http://dev.markitondemand.com/MODApis/) API, we use created a site the will refresh market values of 10 stocks every five minutes. If the user would like to see how much an investment into a certain stock would net him, all he has to do is provide the stock name and the principle investment.

Since we worked on the code in a [seperate repo](https://github.com/dillzhang/ajax_stocks), I just moved it over.
