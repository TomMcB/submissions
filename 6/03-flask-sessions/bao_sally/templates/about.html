  <p> Sometimes animals are animals. <br>
    Other times, they are actually ninjas in disguise. 

    <br><br>

    It looks like a duck. It quacks like a duck.
    <br>
    <i><b>But it's not a duck!</b></i>

    <br><br>

    These animals are employing mimicry (and camouflage).
    <br>
    There are various reasons animals do this.
    <br><br>

    Take the false cleanerfish for example. 

    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    
    Like its name implies, it is a terrible, terrible person that exploits its kind for personal gain. 
    
    <br><br><br><br>

    <br><br>

    Here, the cleaner wrasse and its benefactor are engaged in a beautiful act of symbiosis. 

    <br>

    The wrasse, being a bro, is cleaning the other fish's teeth in return for a meal.  


    <br><br><br>

    Then comes the false cleanerfish, sidling up to one of the wrasse's friends.
    <br>
    It squirrels its  way into the fish's mouth and rips out a chunk of meat.

    <br><br>

    Truly a vile and terrible creature.
