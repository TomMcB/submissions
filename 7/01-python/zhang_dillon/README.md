Rock, Paper, Scissors
=====================

A text input based version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. When one runs the program, it will prompt for a user to type in their selection. The choice can be written as the first initial, uppercase or lowercase, or the whole word, once again uppercase or lowercase. The program will then display the computer's selection, the player's selection, and the result. Finally it prompts the player to play again. If one would like to continue, simply enter 'Yes' and another game will be played.
