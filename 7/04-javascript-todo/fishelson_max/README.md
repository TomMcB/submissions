MASTERMIND:

Operation:
	¥The colored peg at the top represents your selected color.  Click on it to rotate through the possible colors.
	¥Place a peg of the selected color by clicking any of the 4 spaces in the row of your current guess (starting at row 1).  You are able to replace pegs already put down by simply clicking them.
	¥To submit a guess, once all of the pegs are in place in the current row, press the "Submit" button.  The code will not let you submit a guess unless you have placed a peg in every hole.
	¥The code will then tell you how many pegs in your guess were the right color and location, and how many were the right color but in an incorrect location.
	¥Repeated colors can be found in the code you are trying to guess.

Some nice things to note:
	¥The click event listener is only ever active on the slots of the guess row you are currently on to increase efficiency.
	¥If you want to know how to always beat the game in 5 guesses or less: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Algorithms
